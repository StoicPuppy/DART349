        <h2>Content</h2>
        <p>The website I will create is an activist website that highlights the ongoing stray dog crisis in Tunisia. I want to inform people of the horrific violence being conducted towards these poor animals and how the governmentâ€™s refusal to enact a better response has created a long last cycle of bloodshed.</p>

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>I want to use two different fonts for this website.</p>
        <p>Markazi text will be my font of choice for titles and subtitles</p>
        <p>Noto serif is a font I really like and I want to use it for all text the user will read.</p>

        
        <h2>Color palet</h2>
        <p>I want to make use of a variety of shades of black, white and gray to give the website a more contemporary and modernlook. I also want to use some shades of light brown/beige when writing about my dog Ringo's story. Ringo has a black, white and gray coat of fur with some light brown on his cheeks and legs.   </p>

        <h2>Interaction</h2>
        <p>The user will be able to navigate different sections that include stories of dogs being rescued, documented research on the actions being taken by the government to cull dog populations, and actions by activist groups that are taking action to help solve the crisis and save dogs in a humane way.</p>
        <p>The website will include a censored option for users that dont want to see disturbing content while they read. When doing my research I found a lot of website would surround their text with images of dead stray dogs. While the truth of the matter is that a large population of strays are being killed, it makes it harder for readers to consentrate on their reading as well as turns most people away when they see graphic content. I want to ensure that users are comfortable navigating and getting informed</p>
