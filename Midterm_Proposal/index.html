        <h2>Street dogs of Tunis</h2>
        
        <p>I have a chosen a topic near and dear to my heart, street dogs in Tunis. Before being adopted, my dog Ringo was a stray on the streets of Tunisia when he was shot and left for dead by local police. When I first heard this story I thought it was a miracle that he had survived such an attack and the thought of someone doing such a thing to a dog was unthinkable. Unfortunatly this was also when I learnt that this is a tactic that the local police use in order to cull rising population of stray dogs. This results in the death of countless poor animals desperately in need of a food and shelder.</p>
